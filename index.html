      <p>My name is Sonny Desai. I am 43 years old and I live in Rancho Cordova, California. I am married and have a three month old
        daughter named Jasmine. I currently work for a casino in Rancho Cordova. I have been involved in the gaming industry
        off and on for thirteen years. I would like to become a fullstack developer for several reasons. First I would like
        a career where I have normal working hours so I can spend quality time with my family. I would like a career where
        I can constatly use my intellect and creativity. A career that is always growing and offers more potential is always
        desirable. I am definately looking forward to this endeavor. In my spare time I like spending time with my family,
        dining out, exercising, reading, listening to music, traveling, watching sports, and doing photography.</p>
